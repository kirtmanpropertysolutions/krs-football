# KRS College Connect Product Spec

This is the design and behavior spec for KRS College Connect — derived from the working v1 app. The rebuild should match this look and feel, not reinvent it.

## Visual identity

### Colors

The app uses a dark navy base with a crimson accent. These are the core tokens:

- **Background (deepest):** very dark navy, roughly `#0A1628` — the page background
- **Background (card):** slightly lighter navy with a subtle red border glow, roughly `#0F1E36` with a `rgba(220, 38, 38, 0.15)` border
- **Accent (primary action):** crimson red, roughly `#DC2626` to `#B91C1C` — used for primary buttons, active nav state, highlights, the club banner
- **Accent text:** same crimson for links, the word "Admin" next to KRS in admin header, active sidebar items
- **Text (primary):** off-white, roughly `#F9FAFB`
- **Text (muted):** muted gray, roughly `#94A3B8` — for labels, subheadings, placeholder text
- **Success green:** roughly `#10B981` — used for quiz progress bars, "Connect" buttons that succeed, fit percentage badges
- **Warning yellow:** roughly `#F59E0B` — used for the profile completion bar (71%), replied status dot
- **Info blue:** roughly `#3B82F6` — used for Hudl highlight reel section
- **Hot red:** same as accent — used for "Hot" kanban column
- **Purple:** roughly `#A855F7` — used for admin dashboard "Content Items" stat

### Club-specific theming

The Mercer Island Football crimson is the Eastside club color. In a multi-tenant setup, each club should be able to override the primary accent color. The default for now is crimson. Other elements (navy background, text, success green) stay the same across clubs.

### Typography

- **Headings:** use a bold condensed sans-serif display font for section titles and the big all-caps headers like "KAVID DIRTMAN", "SCHOOL FIT QUIZ", "NEXT ACTIONS". Something like **Oswald**, **Bebas Neue**, or **Barlow Condensed** in bold weight. All caps, wide letter spacing.
- **Body:** use a clean sans-serif like **Inter** or **system-ui** for everything else — form fields, body copy, buttons, tables.
- **Stat numbers:** the giant "0" stat card numbers use the display font, very large, bold.

### Logo and branding

- App logo: Mercer Island Football shield + mountains, white on crimson background, small square icon
- App name: "KRS College Connect" with subtitle "Recruiting Platform" (athlete view) or "KRS Admin" with the word Admin in red (admin view)
- In the athlete dashboard header, the club logo appears large next to the athlete's name in a crimson banner

### Layout patterns

**Athlete app (two-column):**
- Left sidebar: fixed 260px wide, dark background, contains logo, "RECRUITING" section (Dashboard, My Profile, School Fit Quiz, Coach Finder, My Schools, Outreach, Recruiting Events), "HIGHLIGHTS" section (Highlights, Video Editor), "NIL" section (NIL Deals), "SOCIAL" section (Social Planner), collapse arrow, athlete mini-card at bottom with avatar/name/class/Sign Out button
- Main content: fills the rest, padded generously, scrolls independently
- Active nav item: crimson background tint + crimson text + crimson left border

**Admin app (top-nav, no sidebar):**
- Horizontal top bar with KRS Admin logo on left, nav items in middle (Dashboard, Athletes, Invite Codes, Announcements, Content Library, Settings), admin name + Sign Out on right
- Main content area below, full width
- Active nav item: crimson background pill

**Cards:** rounded corners (roughly 12px radius), dark navy fill, subtle 1px border in `rgba(220,38,38,0.15)`, padding 24-32px. Stat cards have a crimson top border that glows slightly.

**Buttons:**
- Primary: solid crimson fill, white text, bold uppercase letters, roughly 16px font, 12px vertical padding, rounded corners
- Secondary: dark navy fill, crimson border, crimson text
- Ghost / Learn More: transparent, border, hover fills

**Forms:** dark navy inputs with subtle border, generous padding, white text inside, muted gray placeholder. Labels sit above the field in muted gray small caps.

**Progress bars:** rounded, colored fill (green for quiz, yellow for profile completion), thin (roughly 8px tall).

## Page-by-page spec

### Athlete: Dashboard (`/`)

**Purpose:** landing page after login. Shows snapshot of recruiting activity and nudges toward next action.

**Layout:**
1. Crimson banner at top with club logo + athlete name in big all-caps display font + subtitle "Goalkeeper · Class of 2031 · Mercer Island High School Football"
2. Row of 5 stat cards across: Schools Targeted, Coach Outreach, Social Posts Pending, NIL Deals, Recruiting Events. Each shows a big number and a clickable arrow to drill in.
3. "NEXT ACTIONS" card — lists 2-3 suggested next steps with icons and an "Edit Profile" button per row. Examples: "Add a bio to your recruiting profile", "Add a highlight reel link".
4. Empty state placeholder (dashed border card) for additional content.
5. "GAME SCHEDULE" card with "+ Add Game" button. Empty state: "No upcoming games — Add your schedule so coaches know when to watch you play." Below that, "Sync with TeamSnap" integration card with a green Connect button.
6. On the right side: "Start your streak today!" card with flame icon, 0 Current / 0 Longest / 0 Total Days counters.
7. "PROFILE STRENGTH" card: circular progress ring showing percentage (25%), checklist of items (Highlight URL, GPA, Goals > 0, Bio) with check or empty circle. Bottom text in crimson: "Complete your profile to improve recruiting visibility."
8. "RECRUITING PIPELINE" section at the bottom — empty state "No schools in pipeline yet."

### Athlete: My Profile (`/profile`)

**Purpose:** single form page for athlete to complete their recruiting profile. This drives the Profile Completion score.

**Layout:**
1. "PROFILE COMPLETION" bar at top, yellow fill, percentage on right
2. "PERSONAL INFO" card: Full Name, Position (dropdown), Graduation Year, Club Team, High School, City/State, Jersey Number, Dominant Foot (dropdown), Height, Weight — two columns
3. "ACADEMIC INFO" card: GPA, SAT/ACT Score, Intended Major, Academic Interests, Honors/AP Classes
4. "SOCCER STATS (SEASON)" card: Goals, Assists, Minutes Played, Games Played, Clean Sheets, Shots on Goal, Pass Completion % — three columns of number inputs
5. "SOCIAL MEDIA" card with helper text "These links are auto-included in every email you send to coaches." Four rows with Instagram / X / TikTok / YouTube icons and URL inputs
6. "HIGHLIGHT REELS" card with helper text "Tip: Athletes with highlight reels get 3x more coach responses." Two larger cards: **Trace Profile URL** (orange camera icon, "The #1 video platform for club football. College coaches actively search Trace profiles.") and **Hudl Highlight Reel URL** (blue play icon, "Share your Hudl highlight reel directly with college coaches."). Below them: YouTube Highlights and Veo Link smaller inputs.
7. "BIO / RECRUITING STATEMENT" card with 500-character textarea, placeholder "Write a personal statement that coaches will read. Share your passion for football, your goals, and what makes you unique as a player…"
8. "PROFILE PHOTO" card at bottom (upload widget)

**Save:** implicit — fields save on blur/change. Show a subtle "saved" indicator.

### Forgot password flow (deferred to Phase 5)

**Do not build in Phase 3. Use Supabase dashboard manual password reset for testing until Phase 5 polish.**

**Purpose:** athlete forgets password and wants to reset without admin help.

**UX — not a reset link, a code:**

1. Login page has "Forgot password?" link below the password field
2. Clicking it opens a form asking for email
3. On submit, server generates a 6-digit numeric code (e.g., 482913), stores it in a password_reset_codes table with expiry of 15 minutes, and emails it to the athlete via Resend from noreply@(football domain not set yet)
4. User enters the code on the next screen plus a new password (twice)
5. Server validates the code is unexpired and matches, then updates the Supabase auth password, marks the code as used, and redirects to login

**Why a code not a link:**
- Works across devices — athlete can request on laptop, get code on phone, enter on laptop
- Works even if the athlete's email client strips or mangles reset URLs
- No deep-link handling complexity
- Teenagers find codes more intuitive than email links

**Implementation requirements:**
- New Supabase table: password_reset_codes (id, user_id, code_hash, expires_at, used_at, created_at)
- Store code as hash, not plaintext, so a DB leak doesn't compromise active resets
- Rate limit: max 3 active codes per email per hour
- Server-side API routes: /api/auth/request-reset-code and /api/auth/verify-reset-code
- Resend email template with club branding
- UI screens: RequestResetForm, EnterCodeForm, NewPasswordForm

Do NOT build this in Phase 3. Only document it in the skill for later reference.

### Athlete: School Fit Quiz (`/quiz`)

**Purpose:** 6-question quiz that matches athletes to schools in the database by fit percentage.

**Layout:**
- Header: "SCHOOL FIT QUIZ" + subtitle "Answer 6 quick questions and we'll match you to schools in our database."
- Progress bar with 6 segments — each turns green as answered, current segment is red, unanswered are dark
- "Question N of 6" counter
- Question card with title, subtitle (contextual hint like "Be honest — where you'll play matters more than the division name."), "SELECT ALL THAT APPLY" label in crimson, 3-4 large radio button options each with title and description
- Back / Next buttons at bottom (Next is crimson primary on right, Back is ghost on left)
- Last question's Next button says "See My Matches" instead

**The 6 questions (copy must match exactly):**
1. "What division level are you targeting?" — D1 (Highest competition, most scholarships, biggest time commitment) / D2 (Strong competition, partial scholarships, good balance) / D3 (No athletic scholarships, but great academics & playing time) / NAIA (Scholarships available, smaller schools, competitive football)
2. "Where do you want to go to school?" (Pick all regions you'd be happy in) — Pacific Northwest (WA, OR, ID, MT) / California (CA) / Southwest (AZ, UT, CO, NV) / Open to Anywhere (No geographic preference) — plus others the full app has
3. "What school size do you prefer?" — Small (Under 5,000 students — tight-knit, everyone knows you) / Medium (5,000–15,000 — balanced feel) / Large (15,000+ — big campus, tons of resources and social options)
4. "How important are academics in your decision?" (Be real — would you pick a weaker football program at a better school?) — Top Priority (I want the best school I can get into, football is secondary) / Very Important (Academics and football should both be strong) / Balanced (I want a solid school but football comes first) / Football First (The football program is what matters most to me)
5. "How important is immediate playing time?" (At a top program you may sit for 1-2 years. At a smaller program you could start day one.) — I Need to Start / I'll Compete for It / I'll Wait
6. "What kind of campus environment appeals to you?" (Where would you feel at home for 4 years?) — City / Urban / Suburban / Small Town / Rural / Faith-Based

  - Email me when a new athlete joins (checked by default)
  - Weekly athlete activity summary (checked by default)
  - Alert when athlete goes inactive for 7+ days (unchecked by default)
- "SAVE SETTINGS" crimson button

## Copy rules

- Use lowercase, plain language everywhere. "My Schools" not "Pipeline Management". "Coach Finder" not "Directory of NCAA Coaching Personnel".
- Every button label is a verb: "Add School", "Save Event", "Send Announcement", "Connect", "Retake Quiz".
- Empty states are short and direct: "No schools here yet", "No announcements yet. Send one now." They tell the user what to do next in fewer than 10 words.
- Error messages are plain. "Forbidden use of secret API key in browser" is the kind of string that should never reach a user — server-side issues should be logged and the user should see "Something went wrong — please refresh or contact support."
- Never use "utilize", "leverage", "facilitate". Use "use", "help", "do".
- Never use emoji except in sparingly-chosen places like the streak flame. The current app doesn't use emoji and neither should the rebuild.

## Live data dependencies (CRITICAL)

The v1 app is not running on mock data. The rebuild must account for these real-world data sources from day one — they are not optional polish.

### 1. Recruiting Events calendar
- Real events: BYU Women's Football Prospect Day, Santa Clara Women's Football Prospect Day, etc.
- Each event has: name, school, location, date, registration deadline, cost, type (prospect day / ID camp / showcase / tournament), division, graduation years targeted, description, coach attribution
- **Source:** needs a curated database that gets updated. Options: scrape college athletic department pages, import from a third-party like SportsRecruits or NCSA, or hand-maintained with admin tooling.
- The "RECOMMENDED FOR [NAME]" callout is personalized based on athlete's profile (class year + position + region) — needs a matching algorithm.

### 2. Real coaches directory
- 122 coaches in v1 with verified contact info ("122 college football coaches · Pacific Northwest focus")
- Each coach has: name, title, school, conference, division, email, phone, school domain
- "Find Real Coaches" search hits verified official sources
- "Email Pattern Generator" takes first + last + school domain and outputs common email patterns (firstname.lastname@, firstinitial lastname@, firstname@, etc.)
- **Source:** initial seed from manual scraping of athletic department staff pages. Maintain with admin tooling. Email verification via something like Hunter.io optional.

### 3. Schools database with colors and branding
- School Fit Quiz results show school logo squares with the school's actual brand color as background (BYU dark blue, Utah red, Arizona Wildcats navy/red, Air Force blue, etc.)
- Each school has: name, logo, primary brand color, division, conference, state, enrollment size, academic rank, football program strength, geographic region
- **Source:** seed from NCAA + NAIA public directories. Hex colors from each school's brand guidelines or a service like sportslogos.net. Store in a `schools` table in Supabase.

### 4. NCAA/NAIA structure
- Divisions: D1, D2, D3, NAIA, Junior College
- Conferences: Pac-12 (now dissolved as of 2024 — needs update), Big 12, WCC, Big Sky, Mountain West, NESCAC, etc. — conference memberships change, so this data needs refresh
- Regions: Pacific Northwest, California, Southwest, Midwest, Northeast, Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, Mountain West
- **Source:** NCAA public data, refreshed seasonally

### 5. Outreach email templates
- 4 templates in the current app (Initial Outreach, Follow-Up, Highlight Reel Share, Campus Visit Request)
- Templates use mergeable variables: {{athlete_name}}, {{coach_name}}, {{school_name}}, {{position}}, {{grad_year}}, {{highlight_url}}, {{trace_url}}, {{hudl_url}}, {{social_handles}}
- **Source:** seed templates in code, club admins can add club-specific templates via Content Library

### 6. Social Planner post templates
- Templates are stat-aware and fill in athlete's current numbers (goals, assists, minutes)
- Examples in the v1 app include "Match Day" posts, "Training" posts, "Film session" posts, "Team shoutout" posts
- **Source:** seed templates in code

### 7. Gmail integration
- "Connect Gmail" / "Set Up Gmail" button triggers OAuth
- Once connected, outreach emails land in the athlete's Gmail drafts folder (not sent directly — athlete reviews and sends)
- **Source:** Google OAuth + Gmail API. Requires Google Cloud project, OAuth consent screen, and handling refresh tokens server-side.

### 8. TeamSnap integration (Coming Soon)
- "Sync with TeamSnap" connects to athlete's club team schedule
- Auto-imports upcoming games so they populate the Game Schedule dashboard card
- **Source:** TeamSnap API

### 9. Trace / Hudl / Veo link embedding
- Paste URL to connect — pulls latest highlight thumbnail and metadata
- **Source:** these platforms don't have public APIs for scraping — store URL and show as iframe embed or link-out

## What the rebuild must NOT do

- Do not hardcode athlete names, school lists, or any seed data in the UI code. Everything comes from the database.
- Do not use the service role key in browser code under any circumstances (this is what the current admin dashboard shows broken).
- Do not reintroduce "targeting" as a pipeline status — allowed statuses are contacted / replied / interested / hot / committed / cold. The UI label "TARGETING" maps to "contacted" in the DB (see krs-supabase-schema).
- Do not use emoji except the intentional streak flame.
- Do not add glassmorphism, neon gradients, Vercel branding, or any visual cliché that screams "AI-generated SaaS template".
- Do not add dashboard features that aren't in this spec without asking Chanyn first. Scope creep is how v1 got into its current tangled state.

## Mobile considerations

The v1 app was not mobile-polished. The rebuild should be mobile-first for the athlete app (most athletes will use their phones), and desktop-first for the admin app (coaches and club admins will be at a computer).

Mobile athlete app:
- Sidebar collapses to a hamburger menu
- Dashboard stat cards stack vertically
- Profile form inputs go to full width
- Quiz options stack vertically with larger tap targets
- My Schools kanban becomes a swipeable tab (Targeting / Contacted / Replied / Hot), one column at a time
- Coach cards and event cards single-column
- Social Planner weekly view becomes a day-by-day vertical scroll

## Testing checklist

Before shipping any page in the rebuild, verify:

## Summary

The athlete app is a single-purpose recruiting dashboard for a high school football player — plain language, dark navy theme with crimson accents, sidebar nav, one main card per section, generous whitespace. The admin app is a command center for the club — top nav, stat cards, data tables, form-heavy configuration. Both apps share the same visual vocabulary but different navigation patterns. Real data (events, coaches, schools) drives everything — no mock data in the rebuild.
