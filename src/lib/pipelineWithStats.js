 * Fetch an athlete's pipeline enriched with school info + per-school

 *
 * Previously this issued THREE Supabase round-trips per pipeline row:
 *   - schools .eq(name)
 *   - coaches count by school_id
 *   - outreach .eq(school) .single() for the latest email
 * On an athlete with 20 schools that was 60 sequential trips before
 * the Outreach page could render its pipeline cards.
 *
 * Now: 4 round-trips total regardless of pipeline size — one each for
 * pipelines, schools, coach counts (grouped client-side), and last
 * email per school (grouped client-side). The queries that follow the
 * first run in parallel via Promise.all.
