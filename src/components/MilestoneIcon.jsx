/**
 * MilestoneIcon — maps a milestone's `icon` string (set in the
 * `milestones` table seed) to a real lucide-react icon component.
 *
 * Centralized here so:
 *   - Trophy-case grid, dashboard quest cards, toast popups, and the
 *     /milestones detail sheet all render the same icon for the same
 *     milestone — no drift.
 *   - We can swap an icon globally by editing one row in this map
 *     instead of grepping the codebase.
 *   - Any milestone whose seed icon name isn't in the map falls back
 *     gracefully to a Trophy. Safer than crashing the page if a new
 *     milestone is added with an icon name we don't have yet.
 *
 * We intentionally use only icons known to be exported by the
 * lucide-react version the project has installed (v1.9). Earlier in
 * this project we hit "Instagram is not exported" and "Youtube is not
 * exported" crashes — the safe-name approach prevents that class of
 * bug from ever surfacing for milestones.
