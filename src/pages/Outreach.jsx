  // never block the click handler on a DB roundtrip.

  // Copy subject + body to the clipboard so the athlete can paste into
  // any email client.
  //
  // Two bugs were fixed here in this pass:
  //
  //   1. The original `'\\n\\n'` was a literal backslash-n-backslash-n
  //      string (4 chars), not a paragraph break. Pasted text showed
  //      "Subject: …\n\n…" with visible escape sequences instead of
  //      the formatted email. Now uses real `\n\n` (template literal
  //      with actual newlines).
  //
  //   2. Awaiting `getPlainTextPreview()` before the clipboard write
  //      blew up the iOS Safari user-gesture token the same way it
  //      blew up the mailto: nav — so on mobile, the clipboard write
  //      silently failed (browser threw NotAllowedError). Now we pull
  //      from the cached `preview` state (kept fresh by the useEffect
  //      that watches template/coach/school changes) so the write
  //      happens synchronously inside the click handler.

    // Write BOTH text/plain AND text/html to the clipboard.

    // Why both: iOS Gmail's mobile compose has a known quirk where

    // that one and renders it correctly. The HTML version is just
    // the plain text wrapped in <pre> with HTML entities escaped so
    // it survives as a faithful copy in any rich-text destination.
    //
    // Apple Mail, Outlook, Notes, iMessage etc. all also accept
    // text/html, so this works everywhere — and falls back to the
    // text/plain version on the few clients that don't.

  //     mailto: schemes.
  //   - Logging is fire-and-forget AFTER navigation kicks off — losing
